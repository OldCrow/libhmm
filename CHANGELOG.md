hmm_->setProbabilityDistribution(i, pdist);  // Double ownership!

// AFTER (Fixed):
ProbabilityDistribution* pdist = hmm_->getProbabilityDistribution(i);
pdist->fit(clusterObservations);
// No reassignment needed - HMM already owns the distribution
```

Hmm* hmm = new Hmm(2);
// ... use hmm
delete hmm;
