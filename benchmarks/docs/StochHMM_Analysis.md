## Numerical Implementation Details

### Mathematical Foundation
- Uses `long double` for high precision
- Pre-computed power tables for efficiency
- Template-based math functions
- Automatic overflow/underflow handling

### Algorithm Variants
- **Simple algorithms**: For basic models without advanced features
- **Naive algorithms**: Straightforward implementations for reference
- **Optimized algorithms**: Default implementations with optimizations
- **Stochastic algorithms**: Sampling-based variants

## Benchmarking Considerations

### Strengths
- Comprehensive feature set
- Good numerical stability
- Flexible model definition
- Well-documented API

### Potential Limitations
- No multi-threading (may impact performance)
- No SIMD optimizations
- C++ only (no language bindings)
- Complex feature set may add overhead for simple models

### Fair Comparison Strategy
1. **Use Simple Models**: Compare using basic discrete HMMs to avoid advanced feature overhead
2. **Algorithm Selection**: Use `simple_*` algorithms for basic comparisons
3. **Numerical Settings**: Document scaling and precision settings
4. **Model Equivalence**: Ensure model parameters match other libraries exactly

## Test Implementation Notes

### Model Format
StochHMM uses text-based model files with specific syntax. Will need conversion utilities to ensure identical models across libraries.

### Sequence Format
Supports FASTA and other standard formats. Should integrate well with benchmark data.

### Output Formats
Multiple output options including:
- State sequences
- Probability values
- GFF annotations
- Posterior tables

## Conclusion
StochHMM is a feature-rich library suitable for advanced HMM applications. For benchmarking, we should focus on its core algorithms and ensure fair comparisons by using its simpler algorithm variants when comparing against more basic libraries.
