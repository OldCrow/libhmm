# HMM Library Comparison Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive benchmarking strategy for comparing HMM libraries: libhmm, GHMM, HMMlib, StochHMM, and HTK.

## 1. Library Capability Analysis

### 1.1 Feature Matrix
We need to systematically document what each library supports:

| **Discrete HMMs** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (only) | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Continuous HMMs** | ✓ (1D) | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ (full) |
| **Fixed Symbol Alphabets** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (required) | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Variable Symbol Alphabets** | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Forward Algorithm** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Backward Algorithm** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Viterbi Algorithm** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Baum-Welch Training** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Scaling Methods** | Auto/Manual | Manual | Manual | Manual | Auto |

| **SIMD Optimization** | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| **Performance (relative)** | 1x | 22.8x | 17.9x | 1.9x | Variable* |
| **Numerical Precision** | Full | Full | Full | Full | Rounded |
| **Dependencies** | None | None | Boost | None | None |
| **Language** | C++17 | C | C++ | C++ | C |
| **API Style** | Modern | C-style | Legacy C++ | Mixed | CLI-based |

### 1.2 API Analysis
Document the API patterns for each library:
- How to create models
- How to set parameters
- How to control numerical stability (scaling, log-space)
- How to select algorithms/calculators

- Sequence lengths: 100, 1000, 10000 observations

#### Algorithms to Test:
- Forward probability computation
- Viterbi decoding
- Posterior probability computation
- Parameter estimation (Baum-Welch)

### 2.2 Advanced Discrete HMM Tests

## 3. Benchmark Types

### 3.1 Numerical Accuracy Tests
**Goal**: Validate correctness against known solutions

#### Test Data:
- Synthetic models with known ground truth
- Reference implementations from literature
- Cross-validation between libraries

#### Metrics:
- Absolute error in log-likelihoods
- Relative error in probabilities
- Parameter estimation accuracy
- Convergence behavior

### 3.2 Performance Speed Tests
**Goal**: Measure computational efficiency

#### Metrics:
- Wall-clock time per algorithm
- CPU cycles per operation
- Memory usage patterns
- Scalability with model/sequence size

#### Controlled Variables:
- Same compiler flags
- Same optimization levels
- Same numerical precision
- Same algorithm variants (scaled vs unscaled, log vs linear)

### 3.3 Stability Tests
**Goal**: Test numerical robustness

#### Test Scenarios:
- Very long sequences (underflow prone)
- Very small probabilities
- Ill-conditioned parameter matrices
- Edge cases (empty sequences, single states)

## 4. Fair Comparison Strategy

### 4.1 Algorithm Equivalence
Ensure we're comparing like-with-like:

#### For libhmm:
- Document trait system behavior
- Force specific calculator selection when needed
- Match scaling/log-space settings

#### For other libraries:
- Identify available algorithm variants
- Select equivalent numerical methods
- Document default vs manual settings

### 4.2 Implementation Fairness
- Use optimal settings for each library
- Enable available optimizations (SIMD, threading)
- Use native data formats
- Minimize conversion overhead
